üéØ PURPOSE: Product Sales Performance Aggregation Report
===========================================================================================

This script generates a product-level sales performance report using data from 
`gold.fact_sales` and `gold.dim_products`. It computes key metrics to help stakeholders 
analyze product performance over time, including:

- Total number of orders and distinct customers
- Total and average monthly sales
- Average order value
- Total and average quantity sold
- Category and subcategory breakdowns
- Sales period duration in months

These insights are crucial for understanding sales trends, product popularity, 
and revenue contribution across the product catalog.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üìÅ Tables Used:
  - gold.fact_sales       ‚Üí Contains transactional sales records
  - gold.dim_products     ‚Üí Contains product metadata

üõ†Ô∏è Key Metrics Calculated:
  - `total_sales`                  ‚Üí Sum of all sales per product
  - `average_monthly_sales`       ‚Üí Sales spread evenly across months sold
  - `average_order_value`         ‚Üí Revenue per unique order
  - `average_sales_per_quantity`  ‚Üí Sales amount per unit sold
  - `total_customers`             ‚Üí Reach per product

üì¶ Output:
  One row per product, with performance indicators to support business decisions in 
  product management, marketing, inventory planning, and strategic analysis.
