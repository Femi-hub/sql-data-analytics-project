üìä Purpose: Analyze Yearly Sales Trends with Window Metrics
===========================================================
This script computes yearly revenue trends, including:
1. Total revenue and average price per year
2. A cumulative running total of revenue across years
3. A moving average of yearly average prices

üèóÔ∏è Key Techniques:
- Use of `DATETRUNC(YEAR, order_date)` for yearly grouping
- Window functions (`SUM() OVER`, `AVG() OVER`) for cumulative and moving metrics

üìÇ Source Table:
- gold.fact_sales       -- Transactional sales data

üìå Notes:
- `DATETRUNC` ensures consistent yearly aggregation
- `WHERE` clause filters out NULL dates to avoid invalid groupings
- Results ordered by year to support correct window function computation
