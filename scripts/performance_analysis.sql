ðŸ“Š Purpose: Yearly and Monthly Product Revenue Trend Analysis
==================================================================
This script calculates and compares revenue performance of products over time:
1. Yearly total revenue per product with year-over-year difference & trend
2. Monthly total revenue per product with month-over-month difference & trend

ðŸ§  Techniques Used:
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to isolate yearly and monthly aggregations
- `LAG()` window function to retrieve previous periodâ€™s revenue
- `CASE` logic to label revenue change direction (Increase, Decrease, No Change)

ðŸ“‚ Source Tables:
- gold.fact_sales         -- Contains transactional sales data
- gold.dim_products       -- Contains product metadata

ðŸ“Œ Notes:
- `LEFT JOIN` ensures all sales are included, even if product metadata is incomplete
- `PARTITION BY product_name` allows window functions to operate independently for each product
