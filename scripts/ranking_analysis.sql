=======================================
ðŸš€ Purpose: Top Products and Customers Analysis
=======================================
This script performs data exploration to identify:
1. Top 5 best-selling products by sales amount.
2. Top 3 highest-paying customers.
3. Bottom 3 customers by number of distinct orders.
4. A ranked list using ROW_NUMBER() to retrieve the top 5 products by sales.

ðŸ“‚ Source Tables:
- gold.fact_sales         -- Transactional sales data
- gold.dim_products       -- Product dimension
- gold.dim_customers      -- Customer dimension

ðŸ“Œ Notes:
- LEFT JOIN ensures that all sales are considered even if related product or customer info is missing.
- Aggregations use SUM or COUNT as needed.
- Sorting is applied for ranking purposes.
