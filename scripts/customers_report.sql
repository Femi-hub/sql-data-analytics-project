ðŸ“Š Purpose: Create `gold.report_customers` View for Customer Analytics & Segmentation
====================================================================================
This SQL view provides enriched customer-level analytics for reporting and segmentation.
It aggregates customer behavior over time and derives attributes useful for business decisions:
- Age group classification
- Lifecycle metrics: lifespan, recency
- Behavioral metrics: order count, quantity, spend, product diversity
- Segmentation: VIP, Regular, New
- Derived KPIs: average monthly spend, average order value

ðŸ§  Key Concepts:
- CTEs for intermediate calculations
- Windowed aggregates using GROUP BY
- Conditional logic via CASE expressions

ðŸ“‚ Source Tables:
- gold.fact_sales       -- Transaction-level sales data
- gold.dim_customers    -- Customer demographic information

ðŸ“Œ Output: A summarized, report-ready customer dataset in the `gold` schema
