ðŸ“Š Purpose: Exploratory Data Analysis on Customers & Products
=======================================================
This script provides insights into:
1. Customer distribution by country and gender
2. Product distribution and average cost per category
3. Revenue breakdown by category and customer
4. Quantity sold per customer country

ðŸ“¦ Source Tables:
- gold.dim_customers      -- Customer demographic data
- gold.dim_products       -- Product catalog data
- gold.fact_sales         -- Sales transactions

ðŸ“Œ Notes:
- LEFT JOINs ensure no sales are excluded due to missing product/customer details.
- Aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG) used to compute metrics per group.
