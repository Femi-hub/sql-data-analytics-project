ðŸ“Š Purpose: Category-Wise Contribution to Overall Sales (with Percent of Total)
====================================================================================
This query calculates:
1. Total sales per product category
2. Each category's contribution to overall sales as a percentage
3. Final results sorted by percentage contribution in descending order

ðŸ§  Key Concepts:
- Aggregation (`SUM`) by category
- Use of window function `SUM() OVER ()` to get total sales across all categories
- `CONCAT()` + `ROUND()` to format percentage values

ðŸ“‚ Source Tables:
- gold.fact_sales        -- Transactional sales data
- gold.dim_products      -- Product metadata including category

ðŸ“Œ Notes:
- `LEFT JOIN` ensures all sales are included even if product info is missing.
- `CAST` ensures floating-point division for accurate percentage.
