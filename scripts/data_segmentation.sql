ðŸ“Š Purpose: Product Segmentation by Cost & Customer Segmentation by Spending
===============================================================================
This script performs two segmentation tasks:

1. ðŸ“¦ Product Segmentation:
   - Categorizes products into defined cost ranges.
   - Counts how many products fall into each cost segment.

2. ðŸ‘¥ Customer Segmentation:
   - Calculates customer lifetime value metrics such as:
     - First order date
     - Last order date
     - Total spend
     - Lifespan in months
   - Segments customers into groups: VIP, Regular, or New based on spend and lifespan.

ðŸ“‚ Source Tables:
- gold.dim_products       -- Contains product cost and identifiers
- gold.fact_sales         -- Contains transactional sales and customer keys

ðŸ“Œ Notes:
- Segmentation helps in understanding product pricing distribution and customer value levels.
- `CASE` expressions are used for bucketing products and customers.
- `DATEDIFF` in months is used to compute customer lifespan for segmentation logic.
